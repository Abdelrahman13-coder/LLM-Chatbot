# Larg larnguage Models Chatbot

#### Objective:
Develop a chatbot using Lang Chain or LamaIndex, integrated with OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo API. The chatbot should be able to emulate the speaking styles of two selected public figures from the UAE or Egypt, generating speeches in their voice based on their past speeches.

#### Requirements:
1. **Language and Libraries**: Python.
2. **API Integration**:
    - Utilize OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo API for the core language model.
    - Incorporate Lang Chain or LamaIndex for additional functionalities.
3. **Public Figures Selection**:
    - Choose two prominent public figures from the UAE or Egypt.
    - Gather a dataset of their past speeches for reference.
4. **Speech Generation**:
    - Implement a feature where the bot can generate speeches in the voice of the selected figures.
    - Ensure the generated content reflects the style and typical content of the original speakers.
5. **Input/Output**:
    - User inputs a topic or a prompt.
    - The chatbot responds with a speech in the style of the chosen public figure.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Setup and Configuration**:
   - Install necessary Python libraries (`openai`, `langchain`, `lamaindex`, etc.).
   - Set up a placeholder for the API Key (`API_KEY = "sk-"`).
2. **API Integration**:
   - Configure the OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo API and the chosen Lang Chain or LamaIndex tool.
3. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect and preprocess the dataset of speeches from the selected public figures.
4. **Chatbot Development**:
   - Develop the chatbot functionality, integrating the language model and additional tools.
   - Implement a user interface for inputting prompts and displaying outputs.
5. **Testing and Iteration**:
   - Test the chatbot with various prompts to ensure accurate and realistic speech generation.
   - Iterate based on feedback and performance.

#### Deliverables:
1. **Source Code**: A Python script or a set of scripts for the chatbot.
2. **Documentation**:
   - A README file explaining how to set up and run the chatbot.
   - A brief report on the chosen public figures and the rationale behind the selection.
3. **Demo**: A video or live demonstration showcasing the chatbot's capabilities.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Functionality**: Does the chatbot generate speeches accurately and realistically?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, commented, and easy to understand?
- **Innovation**: Are there any unique features or approaches used in the chatbot?
- **Scalability**: Can the chatbot be easily adapted for additional public figures or different use cases?

#### Submission Instructions:
- Submit all files in a zipped folder via the provided submission link.
- Include any necessary installation and running instructions in the README file.
- Ensure that the API key placeholder is appropriately set up and that no actual API keys are submitted.
