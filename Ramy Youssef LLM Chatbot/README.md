### Project steps:
1. Use a list of Youtube Videos of Ramy's interviews and Standups and use them as knowledge base to our model. ▶️
2. Transform these Youtube Videos into text documents of their transcritpt.
3. Vectoring these documents using Embedding Model.
4. Store the embeddings in Vector DB to be retrived.
5. Provide memory to restore historical conversations.
6. Semantic search from the Vector DB to get the relevant fragments of information for responding.
7. Using **Large language Model** for transforming the data to Natural Language.
8. Use Text to speach to create an enjoyable experince. 
9. Wrap the text using tkinter GUI

### LangChain⛓️
- Imagine LangChain as a LEGO set for building applications with language models (LLMs). Just like LEGO bricks, LangChain provides you with pre-built components called "agents" that you can connect to create complex and powerful applications.

### **Tkinter** How to use:
- Click on the image and then start speaking and then you will find Ramy himself greating you with his sense of humor

### Things to improve:

* Clone Ramy Youssef's voice using deep learning to provid more realism to the experice.
* Develope more sophisticated GUI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and app with Flask.

### Why Ramy Youssef
- As Ramy made a great TV show called **Rami** featured in HULU which made a repesentation of arabs away from the stereotypical prospective protrayed in the media. The show is really funny and features many of Egyption and Arab actors.
