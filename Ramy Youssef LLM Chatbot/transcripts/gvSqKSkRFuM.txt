The questions that happen...
when people who haven't met
each other,
it's amazing. These white mo--
There's really something to it.
'Cause they'll find out
I'm Muslim...
the second they find out,
crazy question.
"Why do you make them
wear that?"
-(STAMMERING) Like who?
-(LAUGHTER)
This woman goes,
"I was in the Middle East,
it was so hot.
It was 100 degrees out,
and this woman had to wear
a scarf and she was sweating.
Why do you make her wear that?"
I was like, "All right,
first of all...
you were in the Middle East.
It wasn't 100 degrees
'cause they use Celsius.
(LAUGHTER)
Maybe it was 30, I...
If it was a 100...
-you would've melted.
-(LAUGHTER)
The other thing is...
just because you don't get it
doesn't mean it's oppressive.
If you step outside
of even your own culture,
things might look weird.
I realized this. You know,
I was on a date in New York.
In January.
It was seven degrees.
-Fahrenheit.
-(LAUGHTER)
The woman I was with was wearing
a really short dress.
You know, she wanted
to look nice.
And we got out of the car.
We were like two blocks away.
And she was like, "What?
It's all the way over there?"
I'm like, "Yeah, come on,
hurry. Quick."
And she's like shivering,
but she can't really move
that fast
'cause her heels
are slowing her down.
And I just look in her eyes
and I see this look of panic.
And she's so cold.
The only thing I could think of
was like, "Fuck...
why do they make her wear that?"
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)
No, but like...
And her...
her hair got all fucked up
from the wind.
It took her like an hour to do.
I was like, "You should have
just worn a scarf.
It would've been...
just so much easier.
You know what I mean?
Just-- Let's just...
Let's just move on
with this thing.
